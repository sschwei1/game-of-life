# GameOfLife

GameOfLife is as the name implies, a webapplication to play conway's game of life. The project is primarily used to learn react with typescript. The aim is to have a working version of game of life, with the possibility to change different settings (e.g. when do cells die, when do they get created, when do they not change at all)

## Current State
After adding the possibility to change all kind of game settings the goal of the project is achieved.

## What could be improved?
- Some parts of the code are very messy and could greatly be improved by moving things into a custom context.
- Furthermore some of the game logic and states could also be moved to a custom hook, handling different things, which would clean up some components as well.
