# GameOfLife

GameOfLife is as the name implies, a webapplication to play conway's game of life. The project is primarily used to learn react with typescript. The aim is to have a working version of game of life, with the possibility to change different settings (e.g. when do cells die, when do they get created, when do they not change at all)
